### PseudoTor

This set of programs implements and simulates a simplified Tor network with one middle node providing anonymity
between the client and server.
It was written as part of PSI (Programowanie Sieciowe, Network Programming) class in semester 23Z (winter 2023).

The project is written in Python, using only the Python standard library.

More detailed documentation is available in Polish in the file `PSI_projekt_koncowy.pdf`.
